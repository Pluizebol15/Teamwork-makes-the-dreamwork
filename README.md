### note: to run game
to run the game:
- clone/download  + extract github
- either:
  1. make a shortcut of the ```main.py``` (right mouse -> create shortcut, then drag shortcut to desktop)
  2. open command console (cmd)
      - *CHANGE PATH TO THE GITHUB FOLDER YOU DOWNLOADED* using ```.../mydir>cd C:/downloads/ect...```. Just copy your path from your file explorer.
      - now use the python command to run ```main.py```: ```.../Teamwork-makes-the-dreamwork>python main.py```.
      - note that everything up to ```>``` is different for you and that is your current directory. Everything after the ```>``` is the command you are going to run.

### File descriptions:
- ```main.py```: central program, run this to play
- ```game_objects.py```: module storing, defining and managing anything that needs to be displayed or moved in game (every object if you will)
- ```settings.py```: module for temporary storing of settings, should use .txt file later
- ```Graphics``` folder: Contains various ```.png``` images ("sprites"). It's all the art for the game.
