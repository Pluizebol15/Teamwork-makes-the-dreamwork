### note: to run game
to run the game:
- clone/download  + extract github
- either:
  1. make a shortcut of the 'main.py' (right mouse -> create shortcut, then drag shortcut to desktop)
  2. open command console (cmd)
      - *CHANGE PATH TO THE GITHUB FOLDER YOU DOWNLOADED* using '***.../mydir>cd C:/downloads/ect...***' just copy your path from your file explorer
      - now use the python command to run 'main.py': ***.../Teamwork-makes-the-dreamwork>python main.py***
      - note that everything up to '>' is different for you and that is your current directory. Everything after the '>' is the command you are going to run

### File descriptions:
- main.py: central program, run this to play
- game_objects.py: module storing, defining and managing anything that needs to be displayed or moved in game (every object if you will)
- settings.py: module for temporary storing of settings, should use .txt file later
- PS.png: quick and dirty player sprite. 'Player Standing'
- bg.png: quick adn dirty background... the lava and pixel effect was actually the hardest
